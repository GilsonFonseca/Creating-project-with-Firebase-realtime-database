# Creating-project-with-Firebase-realtime-database
The idea of this project is to use firebase to store data in firebase.
For this you have to initialized with frebase getting the apikey, the authdomain, the databaseURL, the projectID, the messagingSenderId and the storageBucket. 
After that I got the database with firebase.database(), now is all setted to write on it, in that project I wrote an object with 3 data inside, the object name is it ID and the data is passed by the user. Populating the database, the list with the object will refresh and show the new one bellow of the insert button.
You can see the project working here: [objeto-2b485.firebaseapp.com](https://objeto-2b485.firebaseapp.com)
